If you require a version of ENet for 32 Bit computer systems (ie. Windows 7/8/10 32Bit) then please get in touch, or
you can install the requirements yourself and compile it using ENet-CSharp's MSBuild-based build system.

As such, 32 Bit are no longer included since 1.3.8 due to having to compile them manually. Get in touch if you want me
to compile them for you, but keep in mind that I do not support them when reporting bugs.
